# Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion

### Overview

AI-powered tools such as GitHub Copilot and Tabnine assist developers by predicting and generating code based on natural language comments or partial code. They are trained on large datasets of open-source code and can understand context to offer relevant suggestions.

### How it helps

1. **Increases Productivity:** Reduces repetitive typing and boilerplate code.  
2. **Improves Learning:** Helps new developers understand syntax and logic.  
3. **Speeds Up Prototyping:** Developers can focus on solving problems rather than remembering syntax.  

### Limitations

- AI may suggest **incorrect or insecure code**, requiring developer review.  
- It might reproduce **biased or copyrighted code** from its training data.  

### Example

In `task1_code_completion.py`, I implemented a simple sorting function. With Copilot, the function body and lambda syntax were suggested automatically, saving time.  
This demonstrates how AI speeds up code writing while still needing human validation.
