# Task 2: AI-Driven Automated Testing

### Overview
AI is transforming software testing by using machine learning and natural language processing to automatically generate, execute, and maintain test cases.  
In this task, I used **Selenium** to simulate login tests — AI-based tools extend this by automatically learning test patterns and predicting failure points.

### How it helps
1. **Faster Test Coverage:** AI can generate test cases from code changes or user stories.  
2. **Smart Defect Prediction:** Identifies likely failure points before execution.  
3. **Reduced Maintenance:** Automatically updates tests when the UI or logic changes.  

### Example
In `task2_automated_testing.py`, Selenium simulates valid and invalid logins.  
An AI-enhanced framework could monitor results, detect anomalies, and suggest missing edge cases automatically — improving reliability and reducing manual effort.

### Limitations
AI-driven testing depends heavily on data quality. Poor training data or inconsistent labeling can lead to false positives or missed errors.
